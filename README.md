This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Elixir related to `Enum.reduce` and empty lists. The `bug.ex` file contains code that exhibits unexpected behavior when processing an empty list. The `bugSolution.ex` file provides a corrected version of the code, addressing the potential issues and ensuring more robust functionality.  The issue highlights the importance of considering edge cases and the nuances of Elixir's pattern matching and function arity system when using functions like `Enum.reduce`.
